Your Band Name Generator - Difficulty: Easy
Band Name Generator
A simple Python script that generates a band name by combining the name of the city you grew up in with the name of your pet.
How It Works
The script prompts the user for two inputs:
The name of the city they grew up in.
The name of their pet.
It then concatenates both inputs and displays the generated band name.

Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Running the Script
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/Day-1-Band-Name-Generator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd bandNameGenerator
Run the script:
python band_name_generator.py
Example Output

Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
Enter the city you grew up in: Seattle
Enter the name of your pet: Shadow
Your band name could be: Seattle Shadow
