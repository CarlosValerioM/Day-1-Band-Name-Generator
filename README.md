## Description:
**Band Name Generator** is a simple Python script that generates a creative band name by combining the name of the city you grew up in with the name of your pet. It's a fun, light-hearted tool to create a unique band name.

## How It Works:
1. The script prompts the user for two inputs:
    - The name of the city they grew up in.
    - The name of their pet.
2. It then concatenates both inputs and displays the generated band name.

## Usage:

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Running the Script:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/Day-1-Band-Name-Generator.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Day-1-Band-Name-Generator
```
Run the script:
```bash
python bandNameGenerator.py
```
## Example Output:
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!

Enter the city you grew up in: Seattle

Enter the name of your pet: Shadow

Your band name could be: Seattle Shadow
